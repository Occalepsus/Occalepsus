# Hi there ! I'm Occalepsus :wave:
I am mainly a C++ developper, but I love discovering other things.

Software developer at [CS Group](https://www.cs-soprasteria.com/), I work on Qt and Unreal Engine Software development, as well as Middleware high-performance programming.

Former student at [T√©l√©com SudParis](https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/), I discovered team work and professionnal programming, I also learned Mathematics, Physics or other computer-related things such as signal treatment, video games developpement and robotics.

Don't hesitate to check [my repositories](https://github.com/Occalepsus?tab=repositories)! I made some Unity games (or at least interesting things with Unity like [a cubic-cloud creator](https://github.com/Occalepsus/MapCreator-UnityProject)) and few other things like a [python synchronous server](https://github.com/Occalepsus/PythonSocket-Client-Server) with sockets. I was in the High Level team of a great project for my Robotics association Intech : [TechTheTime-HighLevel](https://github.com/Club-INTech/TechTheTime-HighLevel), we participated at the France Robotic cup.

## DOR√©Mi project :wavy_dash: :
My biggest school project was [DOR√©Mi](https://github.com/Occalepsus/DoReMi-Oculus), *Des Ondes en R√©alit√© Mixte (mixed reality waves)*. This project was requested by physics researchers at T√©l√©com Sudparis to help visualize WiFi sthrength level in space using mixed reality technologies like the Oculus Quest 2 or Microsoft Hololens 2.

At the end we only developed on the Oculus Quest 2, this app can be used for a practicum with students to compare different networks, occlusions, models, etc.

> Releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Occalepsus/DoReMi-Oculus/releases) and installed on Oculus Quest 2.
